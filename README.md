# Airport Simulation Project

The Airport Simulation project is a Java-based simulation that models the operations of an airport, including the management of runways, flight arrivals, and departures. This simulation aims to provide insights into how runways are utilized and how flights are scheduled in a dynamic airport environment.

## Introduction

The Airport Simulation project is designed to simulate the activities of an airport. It includes classes that represent various components of an airport, such as runways, flights, and emergency situations. The simulation provides a graphical interface to visualize the runway statuses, flight information, and emergency scenarios.

## Getting Started

To run the Airport Simulation project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local directory.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
3. Run the 'Application' class to start the simulation.

## Features

The Airport Simulation project offers the following features:

- Simulation of an airport with multiple runways.
- Generation of flights with various airplane models.
- Handling of flight emergencies based on random events.
- Visualization of runway statuses and flight information in a graphical interface.

## Usage

The simulation utilizes several Java classes to create an interactive airport environment. Key classes and their functionalities include:

- 'Airport': Manages runways and their availability.
- 'Flight': Represents individual flights with airplane models, distances, and emergency statuses.
- 'Runway': Represents runways and provides methods for managing delay times and ordering runways.
- 'FlightComparator': Compares flights based on emergency status and generation time.
- 'Application': Main class to initiate the simulation and graphical interface.

The simulation updates flight positions, runway availability, and emergency situations every second. The graphical interface displays real-time information about flights, runways, and emergencies.
